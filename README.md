## 🚀 About Me

I’m a career-transitioning blockchain developer focusing on **real-world use cases**: escrow systems, agricultural tokenization, and supply-chain DApps.

After 20+ years in route logistics and operations, I started learning Web3 and smart contracts and now spend my time:

- Building **milestone-based escrow** for agricultural exports
- Prototyping **RWA tokenization flows** based on real supply-chain problems
- Learning **Solidity + Foundry** through Cyfrin Updraft and hands-on projects
- Gradually improving my **React/Web3 frontend** skills so people can actually use what I build

Right now I’m focused on:
- Getting truly comfortable with **Solidity syntax and patterns**
- Writing better **Foundry tests** (unit + fuzz-style) for my own contracts
- Turning my projects into a **portfolio that can help me land Web3 work**

## 🧠 Technical Focus

### Smart Contracts & Testing
- Solidity (beginner–intermediate)
- Foundry (unit tests, basic fuzzing)
- Escrow & milestone-based payment patterns
- RWA tokenization mechanics (claims, collateral, settlement)
- Smart contract security fundamentals (reentrancy, access control, logic bugs)

### RWA / DeFi
- Milestone-based escrow for agricultural supply chains
- Basic DeFi concepts (ERC-20 flows, swaps, stablecoins)
- Ideas around tokenized receivables and settlement for real businesses

### Frontend & Web3 (Learning)
- React + TypeScript (beginner)
- TailwindCSS
- Basic Web3 integration (MetaMask, simple contract calls)
- dApp UX focused on being **simple for non-crypto users**

### Tools
- Foundry · Remix · VS Code · Git/GitHub
- Cursor (AI-assisted coding)
- MetaMask & testnets

## ⭐ Featured Work

- **Gulupa / Agricultural Escrow (RWA Prototype)**  
  Milestone-based escrow contract for agricultural exports. Funds are locked in a stablecoin and released when predefined milestones (harvest, processing, shipment, etc.) are completed. Tested with Foundry and designed as a building block for RWA flows.

- **Asset Loader DApp (Supply Chain / Logistics)**  
  Smart contract + frontend concept to track loading of route trucks, reduce misloads, and give managers visibility into truck/bay status. Inspired by my real-world logistics background.  
  _Repo:_ (add link here)

- **Teach Me Solidity / Teach Me Foundry**  
  Self-study repos where I practice Solidity syntax, build small focused contracts, and write tests with Foundry to prepare for Cyfrin’s SSCD+ certification.  
  _Repo:_ (add link here)

- **TrustEd (Mentored Frontend Project)**  
  Worked under a senior Web3 instructor using **Cursor** with React + TypeScript + TailwindCSS to implement and refine frontend pages for a decentralized education dApp. Focused on layout, basic Web3 integration, and making sure the app behaved correctly in demos.

## 📚 Ongoing Learning

- **Cyfrin Updraft** – Solidity, Foundry, smart contract security, wallet security  
- **SSCD+ Prep** – Smart contract security certification track (exploits, fuzzing, testing)

I’m actively looking for **junior smart contract / Web3 roles** and opportunities to work on **RWA, escrow, or supply-chain–focused projects**.
