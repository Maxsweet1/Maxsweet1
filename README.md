# 🌐 Greg Thompson-Lowe — Smart Contract / Web3 Developer

**Smart Contracts · Escrow & RWA Flows · Ethereum · Foundry**

I’m a smart contract / Web3 developer transitioning from 20+ years in logistics and operations, now focused on escrow, RWA settlement, and supply-chain–driven contracts.

I’m currently open to:

- **Junior Smart Contract / Web3 Developer roles**
- **Freelance / contract work** on escrow, payments, RWA, and simple DeFi integrations

---

## 🔎 What I Work On

**Core themes:**

- Milestone-based **escrow systems** for real trade flows (agricultural exports, supply chain)
- **RWA-style settlement**: tokenized claims on work performed or goods delivered
- Simple **DeFi / payment flows** built on ERC-20 tokens
- Practical dApps that non-crypto users can actually use

My background in route sales and operations shapes how I design contracts: I care about how money, goods, and responsibility move in the real world, then map that into clean on-chain flows.

## 🧠 Skills Snapshot

### Smart Contracts & Testing

- Solidity (escrow, payout logic, RWA-style flows, basic DeFi patterns)
- Foundry (unit tests, basic fuzz testing)
- ERC-20 flows, role-based access control, state-machine style logic
- Security fundamentals: reentrancy, access control issues, logic bugs

### RWA / Escrow / Supply Chain

- Milestone-based escrow for agriculture and cross-border trade
- On-chain tracking of progress, approvals, and payouts
- Thinking in terms of claims, obligations, and settlement conditions

### Frontend & Web3 Integration

- React + TypeScript (implementing features from specs)
- TailwindCSS for UI
- Basic Web3 integration (MetaMask, ethers.js/Wagmi-style flows)
- UX focused on clear, guided flows for non-technical users

### Tools

- Foundry · Remix · VS Code · Git/GitHub  
- MetaMask & EVM testnets  
- AI-assisted workflows: **Cursor**, **Claude Code** (for scaffolding and refactors, followed by manual review and debugging)

## ⭐ Selected Projects

### DED — Decentralized Education Protocol (Current Work)

**Role:** Web3 Developer (contract / project-based)

Working on **DED**, a decentralized education protocol for verifiable, peer-to-peer learning.

- Implement React + Tailwind components from product and design requirements  
- Connect frontend flows to existing smart contracts (escrow, reputation, proof-of-learning, etc.) and wallet interactions  
- Use AI-assisted tools (Cursor, Claude Code) to scaffold implementations, then manually refine, debug, and align behavior with the requested UX  
- Collaborate directly with the project founder to ensure the dApp is functional and demo-ready

### Gulupa Escrow — RWA Escrow Prototype

Smart contract for **milestone-based escrow** in an agricultural export workflow based on real-world fruit exports.

- Deposits stablecoin funds into escrow for a farmer / producer  
- Releases payouts only when predefined milestones (e.g., harvest, processing, shipment) are completed  
- Clear lifecycle: created → funded → milestones completed → **released or refunded**  
- Tested with Foundry for core flows, failure cases, and access control

### Asset Loader — Supply-Chain Smart Contract

Solidity-focused project drawing directly from 20+ years in route logistics.

- Smart contract to track which products are loaded into which truck bays, by which loader, and when  
- Designed to reduce misloads, increase accountability, and give managers visibility into loading status  
- Frontend experiments were primarily AI-assisted; the core value is the **Solidity contract and process design**

### 💼 Hiring / Collaboration

If you’re building:

- Escrow or payment rails  
- RWA or settlement logic tied to real-world goods/services  
- Simple DeFi integrations on Ethereum / EVM  
- Decentralized education or reputation systems

…I’m interested in talking — especially where my mix of **on-chain development** and **off-chain operations experience** can actually move the needle.
